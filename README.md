# Project 1

This project explores the use of Monte Carlo simulations and Discrete Convolution theorem for probability calculations in solving real-world statistical problems. The goal of this project is to simulate scenarios where outcomes are uncertain and demonstrate how simulations can provide insights into the probability of winning a game.

## Key Objectives
Simulate random events using Monte Carlo methods.
Calculate the probability of a specific outcome (e.g., winning a game).
Analyze the results to provide statistical insights.
Demonstrate the implementation of the reflection principle and ballot theorem in solving probability tasks.
