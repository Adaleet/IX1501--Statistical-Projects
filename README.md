# Project 1 - Probability distribution of a sum of independent random variables

This project explores the use of Monte Carlo simulations and Discrete Convolution theorem for probability calculations in solving real-world statistical problems. The objective is to use these methods to solve a problem related to estimating the probability of a particular event occurring over a series of trials.

## Key Objectives
Simulate random events using Monte Carlo methods.
Calculate the probability of a specific outcome (e.g., winning a game).
Analyze the results to provide statistical insights.
Demonstrate the implementation of the reflection principle and ballot theorem in solving probability tasks.

# Project 2 - Bootstrapping Method for Probability Estimation
 
This project aims to estimate a probability based on a sample of 10 independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. The true distribution of the variables is unknown, as is their mean value. The goal is to estimate the probability that the sample mean, adjusted for the unknown mean, lies within a specific range using the Bootstrap method.

The bootstrap method is a powerful resampling technique that allows us to make statistical inferences about a population by repeatedly resampling from the original data. This method is particularly useful when the sample size is small or the underlying distribution is unknown.
